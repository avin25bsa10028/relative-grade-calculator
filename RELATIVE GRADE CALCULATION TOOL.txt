                RELATIVE GRADE CALCULATION SYSTEM
------------------------------------------------------------

Project Title:
--------------
Relative Grade Calculation System – Excel-Based Student Evaluation Tool


Introduction:
--------------
This project implements a fully automated **Relative Grade Calculation System** 
designed for teachers. Instead of using fixed cut-off marks, this system evaluates 
every student’s subject performance relative to the entire class.

In relative grading, a student's grade depends on how well they perform compared 
to their classmates, not just their raw score. This ensures fairness, balanced 
distribution, and statistical accuracy.

The system reads marks from an Excel file and immediately displays:
• Subject-wise marks  
• Relative grades (S, A, B, C, D, E)  
• Absolute fail detection (<40 = F)  
• Clean and organized result view  
• Fast and error-free grade generation  


Motivation:
-----------
Manual grading becomes difficult and time-consuming when handling large classes.  
Teachers often face problems like:

• Inconsistent grading  
• Time-consuming calculations  
• Human errors  
• Difficulty deciding grade boundaries  

Relative grading solves these issues because it:
• Compares every student fairly  
• Distributes grades logically  
• Rewards actual top performers  
• Ensures class-level fairness  

This tool automates the entire relative grading workflow using a modern GUI that 
any teacher can operate easily.


Data Description:
-----------------
The system uses a simple Excel (.xlsx) file as input.

Required Format:
----------------
Column 1  → Registration Number  
Column 2  → Subject 1 Marks  
Column 3  → Subject 2 Marks  
...continue for all subjects...

Example Template:
-----------------
Reg No | Subject 1 | Subject 2 | Subject 3 | Subject 4  
101    |    82     |     75    |     90    |     87  
102    |    50     |     48    |     41    |     60  

Each row represents a student.  
Each column after “Reg No” represents that subject’s marks.


How the System Processes the Data:
----------------------------------
After uploading an Excel file:

1. All subject names are read dynamically  
2. All marks are converted safely (empty/invalid cells treated as 0)  
3. Each subject is graded separately using **relative grading**  
4. The system computes percentile groups  
5. Each student’s score is compared with the whole class  
6. Grades are assigned based on ranking, not fixed marks  


Relative Grading Criteria (Detailed):
-------------------------------------
Relative grading does not use absolute cut-offs (like 90+ = A).  
Instead, it ranks students within the class and assigns grades accordingly:

**S Grade → Top 2% performers**  
**A Grade → Next 10% performers**  
**B Grade → Next 20% performers**  
**C Grade → Next 20% performers**  
**D Grade → Next 20% performers**  
**E Grade → Remaining students**  

These categories ensure grades fall into a statistically distributed curve.

Important Rule:
---------------
Regardless of ranking,
**If a student scores below 40 in any subject → Grade = F (Fail).**

This means:
Relative grading = applied only if mark ≥ 40  
Absolute fail = mark < 40  


Why Relative Grading?
---------------------
• Better reflects actual performance  
• Removes the pressure of fixed cut-off marks  
• Highlights true toppers  
• Prevents grade inflation  
• Makes grading fair even if the exam was too hard or too easy  


How to Use This Application:
----------------------------
1. Run the Python program:  
   `grade_calc_premium.py`

2. Upload the Excel file OR drag & drop it onto the window.

3. Wait for “File Loaded ✓” message.

4. Enter any student's Registration Number.

5. Click “Show Result” to view:
   • Subject-wise marks  
   • Relative grade  
   • Pass/Fail status  

(Optional)  
Use “Download Template” to generate a ready-made Excel format.
